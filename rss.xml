            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How to Build a Solid Drinking Library</h1><p>Are there places I like as much as great bars? Yes: great bookshops. And if I had to pick a favorite in the latter category, it's Dog Ears Book Barn in the little town of Hoosick, N.Y. Conveniently, it's just a little ways down Route 7 from the Man of Kent, one of America's best bars.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/0273a33607950225cc804b6b0df8a694a29cdeef.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Great Barrier Reef's Best Hope Is a Killer Robot</h1><p>Crown-of-thorns starfish are the zombies of the sea. They won't die even if you cut them in half. To kill one, you must dismember it completely-or inject it with poisonous (to them) bile salts. Instead of braaains, these zombies munch coral, and off the coast of Australia, infestations of the beasts are damaging the Great Barrier Reef at an alarming rate.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/df2ff642b24f92833cf4da9277a687034f647587.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Google May Have Found a Way to Make the Real-World Web Work</h1><p>Remember beacons? Honestly, there's not much reason you would. Hailed for years by Apple, Google, and beyond as one of the next big things in tech-for marketers, at least-the glorious beacon future has yet to arrive in the present. They may get a little closer, however, now that Google has solved one of their major issues.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/60f00415e118224ecabc9f288eafe337a9d94455.jpg"></article>]]></description>
